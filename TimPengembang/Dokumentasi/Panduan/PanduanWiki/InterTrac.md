## InterTrac Links
Trac supports a convenient way to refer to resources of other Trac servers,
from within the Wiki markup, since version 0.10.
### Definitions
An InterTrac link can be seen as a scoped TracLinks. It is used for referring
to a Trac resource (Wiki page, changeset, ticket, ...) located in another Trac
environment.
### List of Active InterTrac Prefixes
Prefix Trac Site
trac   The_Trac_Project
### Link Syntax
Simply use the name of the other Trac environment as a prefix, followed by a
colon, ending with the resource located in the other environment.
<target_environment>:<TracLinks>
The other resource is specified using a regular TracLinks, of any flavor.
That target environment name is either the real name of the environment, or an
alias for it. The aliases are defined in trac.ini (see below). The prefix is
case insensitive.
If the InterTrac link is enclosed in square brackets (like [th:
WikiExtrasPlugin]), the InterTrac prefix is removed in the displayed link, like
a normal link resolver would be (i.e. the above would be displayed as
WikiExtrasPlugin).
For convenience, there's also some alternative short-hand form, where one can
use an alias as an immediate prefix for the identifier of a ticket, changeset
or report: (e.g. #T234, [T1508], [trac 1508], ...)
### Examples
It is necessary to setup a configuration for the InterTrac facility. This
configuration has to be done in the TracIni file, [intertrac] section.
Example configuration:
...
[intertrac]
# -- Example of setting up an alias:
t = trac
# -- Link to an external Trac:
trac.title = Edgewall's Trac for Trac
trac.url = http://trac.edgewall.org
The .url is mandatory and is used for locating the other Trac. This can be a
relative URL in case that Trac environment is located on the same server.
The .title information will be used for providing an useful tooltip when moving
the cursor over an InterTrac links.
Finally, the .compat option can be used to activate or disable a compatibility
mode:
    * If the targeted Trac is running a version below ​0.10 (​r3526 to be
      precise), then it doesn't know how to dispatch an InterTrac link, and
      it's up to the local Trac to prepare the correct link. Not all links will
      work that way, but the most common do. This is called the compatibility
      mode, and is true by default.
    * If you know that the remote Trac knows how to dispatch InterTrac links,
      you can explicitly disable this compatibility mode and then any TracLinks
      can become an InterTrac link.
Now, given the above configuration, one could create the following links:
    * to this InterTrac page:
          o trac:wiki:InterTrac ​trac:wiki:InterTrac
          o t:wiki:InterTrac t:wiki:InterTrac
          o Keys are case insensitive: T:wiki:InterTrac T:wiki:InterTrac
    * to the ticket #234:
          o trac:ticket:234 ​trac:ticket:234
          o trac:#234 ​trac:#234
          o #T234 #T234
    * to the changeset [1912]:
          o trac:changeset:1912 ​trac:changeset:1912
          o [T1912] [T1912]
    * to the log range [3300:3330]: (Note: the following ones need
      trac.compat=false)
          o trac:log:@3300:3330 ​trac:log:@3300:3330
          o [trac 3300:3330] ​[trac_3300:3330]
    * finally, to link to the start page of a remote trac, simply use its
      prefix followed by ':', inside an explicit link. Example: [th: Trac
      Hacks] (since 0.11; note that theremoteTrac has to run 0.11 for this to
      work)
The generic form intertrac_prefix:module:id is translated to the corresponding
URL <remote>/module/id, shorthand links are specific to some modules (e.g.
#T234 is processed by the ticket module) and for the rest (intertrac_prefix:
something), we rely on the TracSearch#quickjump facility of the remote Trac.
